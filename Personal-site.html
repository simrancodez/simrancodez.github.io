<summary> Music </summary> 
<p> One of my favorite things to do is listen to music! The best genres (in my opinion) are grunge, shoegaze, classic rock, R&amp;B, Jazz, and Nu Metal. 
</details>
<details> <summary> Books </summary> 
<p> I love to read classics and different feminist/dystopian novels! A few of my current favorites are The Color Purple, 1984, The Bell Jar, My Year of Rest and Relaxation, Song of Solomon, and Sula. It's a long list, but I reccomend anything Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Sylvia Plath, Oscar Wilde, or Franz Kafka! </p></details>
